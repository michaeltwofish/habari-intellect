Description
-----------

Intellect is a clean, minimalist theme exclusively for Habari based on a design I had for my site from October to December of 2009. As you might imagine, since the majority of the markup and CSS are circa 2009 there are some aspects of it that may cause cringing. Specifically this period was when I was first learning about HTML5. As such, there may be misused section tags among others. You will also run across things such as form#message in the CSS for example. Don't worry, I'm embarrassed for myself.
